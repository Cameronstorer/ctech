<h1>A Little About the Author</h1>

<div class="aboutMeContainer">
<img src="../assets/portrait.jpg" alt="portrait">
<p alt="portrait" >Hi, I am Cameron Storer, a current sophomore studying Computer Science 
at Louisiana Tech University. I've had a passion for programming and computers ever since I homebrewed
my Nintendo 3DS and installed my first Minecraft mod. Today, I have an itch to crawl further and
further down the deep hardware and software rabbit hole. I am always interested in learning new things
and will never tire of writing programs.
