<h1>What's the Purpose?</h1>

<p>Welcome to Cameron's Tech Journal! This site serves the purpose of sharing

more specifically on computers and programming.</p>

<h1>A Little About the Author</h1>

<div class="aboutMeContainer">

    <p alt="portrait" >Hi, I am Cameron Storer, a current sophomore studying Computer Science 
    at Louisiana Tech University. I've had a passion for programming and computers ever since I homebrewed
    my Nintendo 3DS and installed my first Minecraft mod. Today, I have an itch to crawl further and
    further down the deep hardware and software rabbit hole. I am always interested in learning new things
    and will never tire of writing programs.

<h1>How was this Created?</h1>

<p>This site is made up entirely of the languages html and css with small amounts of javascript
    included. It is currently hosted for free on Github Pages. The code editor of choice used
    to code this site was VS Code and Gitbash was used to commit and push updates. The languages
    needed were researched with help from Google's Gemini LLM.
